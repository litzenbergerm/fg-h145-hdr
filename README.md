# fg-h145-hdr
HDR/PBR model version of the H145M helicopter for the flightgear flight simulator

Download and rename the aircraft folder to "ec145" to work correctly in fg. 

This model is highly experimental and used for exploring HDR/PBR features of fg 2010.4.0 .
Many features of the aircraft may be unusable or inaccessible due to that.

For a stable version of the H145M helicopter for fg download it from the FGUK hangar.
